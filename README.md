📂 Data Structure Management System
A Java project demonstrating the use of Stack, Queue, Linked List, and BST to manage items efficiently.

📌 Overview
This project implements a console-based management system that organizes items using multiple data structures:

Stack → Undo delete functionality

Queue → Priority-based processing (urgent/normal)

Singly Linked List (SLL) → Efficient insertion/deletion

Binary Search Tree (BST) → Fast searching by ID

✨ Features
✔ CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✔ Undo Deletion (Stack-based)
✔ Priority Handling (Queue for urgent/normal items)
✔ File Storage (Save/load items in JSON format)
✔ Search Items (By ID, name, or category)

⚙️ How It Works
1. Data Structures Used
Structure	Purpose
Stack	Last-in-first-out (LIFO) undo for deletions
Queue	Priority-based (urgent items processed first)
SLL	Dynamic storage with fast insert/delete
BST	O(log n) search by ID
2. Functionality
Add Item (ID, name, description, category, priority)

View All Items (Displays in linked list order)

Update Item (Modify fields by ID)

Delete Item (Moves to stack for undo)

Search Items (By ID)

Process Urgent Items (Queue-based)

Save/Load (Persistent JSON storage)

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java JDK 17+
